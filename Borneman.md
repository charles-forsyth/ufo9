Allocation Review Committee Report: Borneman Lab – Microbial Transcriptome Analysis

Executive Summary

The Borneman Lab (Microbiology and Plant Pathology) requests an 8-week extension of their GCP allocation to refine their analysis of the citrus microbial transcriptome. This project builds upon previous work, aiming to develop a new pipeline for more complete microbial genome assembly, focusing on candidates identified in their prior research.  The expected outcomes include improved understanding of citrus microbiome interactions, potentially leading to new strategies for managing citrus diseases.

Narrative Story

Citrus greening disease, or Huanglongbing (HLB), poses a severe threat to the citrus industry.  Understanding the complex interplay between citrus trees and their microbial communities is critical for developing effective disease management strategies.  The Borneman Lab has been leveraging GCP resources to analyze the citrus microbial transcriptome, seeking to identify key microbial players involved in HLB progression or resistance.  Initial research highlighted promising microbial candidates, and this proposed extension aims to refine their analysis pipeline.  By constructing more complete microbial genomes, the researchers can gain deeper insights into the functional roles of these microbes within the citrus ecosystem.  This refined pipeline will accelerate the pace of discovery and potentially reveal novel targets for HLB intervention.

Estimated Value

The value of this project is multifaceted.  The primary tangible benefit lies in the potential for identifying microbial targets for HLB management.  This could lead to the development of new biocontrol strategies or other interventions, potentially mitigating the economic impact of HLB on the citrus industry, which amounts to billions of dollars annually.  Intangible benefits include advancing our fundamental understanding of plant-microbiome interactions and strengthening UCR’s position as a leader in citrus research.  While quantifying the exact economic impact is premature at this stage, the potential for substantial downstream benefits is clear. The improved pipeline's efficiency translates to accelerated research progress, potentially saving months of computational time, which is difficult to quantify monetarily but represents a significant research advantage.

GCP Cost Estimate

Estimating precise GCP costs requires further information from the Borneman Lab. While the request specifies the desired compute power (128 cores per node, 9-16 nodes), crucial details regarding memory requirements, attached disk configuration, and specific disk volumes (ranging from 1TB to 20TB) are missing. These variations dramatically impact cost projections.  Additionally, understanding the usage patterns (e.g., continuous vs. intermittent usage) is essential for accurate estimation.

Based on the request for high-performance compute, assuming 12 nodes with 128 cores and 256GB RAM per node, and a conservative estimate of 10TB of persistent disk storage, with continuous usage over 8 weeks, a rough estimate would be in the range of $15,000 - $25,000. This is a preliminary figure, and a detailed breakdown by service (compute, storage, networking) requires the missing specifics.  The lab's statement about maintaining existing resources also needs clarification to incorporate those costs into the total estimate.

Recommendation

We conditionally recommend approving the Borneman Lab's allocation extension. The research addresses a critical problem with significant potential impact.  The justification for increased computational resources is sound, aiming to accelerate the research timeline. However, the allocation request lacks sufficient detail for accurate cost estimation. We recommend requesting further information from the PI regarding memory requirements, disk configuration, usage patterns, and costs associated with maintaining existing resources. Once these details are provided, a final cost estimate and a firm recommendation can be made.  This clarification will ensure responsible resource allocation and facilitate accurate budget planning.
