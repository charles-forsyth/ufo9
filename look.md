# Creating a Genomics Nextflow Pipeline on a University HPC Cluster

## Introduction

This article provides a comprehensive guide to creating and running genomics pipelines using Nextflow on a university High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. We will cover the essential concepts, from setting up your environment to designing, implementing, and managing your pipelines. The aim is to equip junior researchers with the practical knowledge and skills necessary to leverage the power of Nextflow and HPC for their genomics research. We will emphasize reproducibility, scalability, and best practices throughout the article.

**Example:**

Imagine you're analyzing RNA-Seq data to identify differentially expressed genes. This involves multiple steps: quality control, read alignment, transcript quantification, and statistical analysis. A Nextflow pipeline can automate this entire process, ensuring each step is performed consistently and efficiently on the HPC cluster.

### What is Genomics and Why Use Pipelines?

Genomics is the study of genomes, the complete set of genetic material in an organism. It involves analyzing vast amounts of DNA and RNA sequence data to understand gene function, disease mechanisms, and evolutionary relationships. Due to the scale and complexity of genomic data, manual analysis is impractical. Pipelines automate the processing of genomic data by chaining together a series of tools and scripts. This provides a structured and reproducible approach, ensuring consistent results across multiple datasets and analyses. Pipelines are especially crucial for handling the "big data" generated by modern sequencing technologies.

**Example:**

Consider a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) experiment aiming to identify genetic variants associated with a specific disease. The raw sequencing data needs to be processed through several stages: read alignment to a reference genome, variant calling, and variant annotation. A pipeline automates these steps, standardizes the analysis, and allows you to efficiently analyze hundreds or thousands of samples.

### What is Nextflow?

Nextflow is a workflow management system (WMS) that simplifies the creation and execution of complex computational pipelines. It uses a dataflow programming model, where processes are triggered automatically when their input data is available. Nextflow excels in handling data dependencies, parallelization, and error management. Its key advantages include portability (it can run on different computing environments, including HPC clusters and cloud platforms), reproducibility (it tracks software versions and dependencies), and scalability (it can efficiently handle large datasets). Nextflow uses a domain-specific language (DSL) built on top of Groovy, making it easy to define pipelines with clear and concise syntax.

**Example:**

Instead of writing a complex shell script to manage dependencies and execute tools sequentially, you can use Nextflow to define processes, specify their inputs and outputs, and let Nextflow handle the execution. For example, you can define a process for aligning reads using Bowtie2, specifying the input as FASTQ files and the output as a BAM file. Nextflow then automatically manages the execution of Bowtie2 for each FASTQ file and ensures the output BAM files are available for subsequent processes.

### What is an HPC Cluster and Why Use It?

A High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster is a collection of interconnected computers (nodes) that work together as a single system to solve complex computational problems. HPC clusters provide the massive computational power, memory, and storage needed to analyze large genomics datasets. They typically utilize a scheduler (e.g., Slurm, PBS) to manage resources and distribute jobs across the available nodes. HPC clusters are essential for genomics research because many analyses, such as genome assembly or variant calling on large cohorts, require significant computational resources that are not available on personal computers or even individual servers.

**Example:**

Imagine trying to align billions of sequencing reads to a reference genome on your laptop. It could take days or even weeks. An HPC cluster, with its hundreds or thousands of CPU cores and terabytes of memory, can complete the same task in a matter of hours or even minutes.

### Why Use Nextflow on an HPC Cluster for Genomics?

Combining Nextflow with an HPC cluster offers several compelling advantages for genomics research. Nextflow handles the orchestration of the pipeline, while the HPC cluster provides the computational resources. Nextflow can automatically submit jobs to the HPC scheduler, distribute tasks across multiple nodes, and manage dependencies between processes. Containerization technologies (like Docker or Singularity) integrate seamlessly with Nextflow to ensure reproducibility across different HPC environments. This combination allows researchers to focus on the scientific questions rather than the complexities of managing computational infrastructure and software dependencies.

**Example:**

You can define a Nextflow pipeline that performs variant calling on thousands of whole-genome sequencing samples. Nextflow will automatically divide the samples into smaller batches, submit each batch as a separate job to the HPC cluster, and then collect and merge the results. This parallelization dramatically reduces the overall analysis time.

### Overview of Article Structure

This article is structured to guide you through the process of creating and running genomics pipelines with Nextflow on an HPC cluster. We will start by showing you how to set up your HPC environment. Next, we'll introduce the fundamentals of Nextflow, covering its syntax, structure, and key features. The central part of the article will focus on designing and implementing a genomics pipeline, including best practices for reproducibility and scalability. Finally, we'll cover how to run and manage your pipeline on the HPC cluster, including monitoring job progress and troubleshooting common issues. The article also covers advanced topics and provides resources for further learning.

**Example:**

This article will walk you through creating a simple read alignment pipeline. You will learn how to define the alignment process using Nextflow, package the required alignment tool (e.g., Bowtie2) in a container, and submit the pipeline to your university's HPC cluster using Slurm or PBS scheduler.

## Setting Up Your HPC Environment

Before you can start running Nextflow pipelines, you need to set up your environment on the HPC cluster. This involves accessing the cluster, understanding the file system, loading necessary software modules, and configuring your environment variables.

**Example:**

Your university's HPC cluster might require you to connect using SSH and a VPN. You'll also need to know the paths to shared storage and scratch directories on the cluster.

### Accessing the HPC Cluster (SSH, VPN)

The first step is to gain access to the HPC cluster. Typically, this involves using SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to the cluster's head node. You might also need to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) if you are connecting from outside the university network. Your university's IT support should provide you with the necessary credentials and instructions. Common SSH clients include OpenSSH (available on Linux and macOS) and PuTTY (for Windows).

**Example:**

To connect using SSH, you might use a command like: `ssh your_username@hpc_cluster_address.edu`. You might also need to set up SSH keys for passwordless login, improving security and convenience.

**Tip:** Setting up SSH keys allows you to connect to the HPC cluster without entering your password every time. This can significantly improve your workflow.

### Understanding the HPC Cluster File System

HPC clusters typically have a complex file system hierarchy. It's crucial to understand the different directories and their purposes. Common directories include: `$HOME` (your home directory), `/scratch` or `$TMPDIR` (temporary storage for large files), and `/shared` or `/project` (shared storage for project data). Be aware of storage quotas and policies associated with each directory. Using the appropriate directories for different types of data is essential for efficient and reliable pipeline execution.

**Example:**

Avoid running computationally intensive tasks directly in your `$HOME` directory as it usually has limited storage space. Instead, copy input data to `/scratch` or `$TMPDIR` before running your pipeline and write the final results to `/shared` or `/project`.

**Alert:** Always check the storage quotas and policies of each directory on the HPC cluster to avoid running out of space or violating usage guidelines.

### Loading Required Modules (e.g., Nextflow, Singularity/Docker)

HPC clusters use environment modules to manage software installations. You need to load the modules for Nextflow and any containerization software you plan to use (e.g., Singularity or Docker). The module system allows you to easily switch between different versions of software without conflicts. Use the `module avail` command to list available modules, `module load <module_name>` to load a module, and `module list` to see which modules are currently loaded.

**Example:**

To load Nextflow and Singularity modules, you might use the commands: `module load nextflow` and `module load singularity`. After loading the modules, you can verify that Nextflow is installed by running `nextflow -v`.

**Tip:** Create a shell script to automatically load the necessary modules when you log in to the HPC cluster. This can save you time and ensure that you always have the correct software versions loaded.

### Configuring Your Environment (Setting Paths, etc.)

You may need to configure your environment variables to ensure Nextflow and other tools can find the necessary files and libraries. This can be done by modifying your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file in your home directory. Add the paths to any custom scripts or libraries to the `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables, respectively. Remember to source the file (`source ~/.bashrc`) after making changes to apply them to your current session.

**Example:**

If you have a custom script located in `/home/your_username/scripts`, you can add it to your `PATH` by adding the following line to your `.bashrc` file: `export PATH=$PATH:/home/your_username/scripts`. Then, run `source ~/.bashrc` to update your environment.

**Alert:** Be careful when modifying your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file, as incorrect settings can cause problems with your environment. Always back up the file before making changes.

### Testing Your Setup

After configuring your environment, it's important to test that everything is working correctly. Verify that Nextflow is installed and accessible by running `nextflow -v`. Test that you can load and run Singularity or Docker containers by pulling a simple image and running a command inside the container. This ensures that your environment is properly configured before you start building complex pipelines.

**Example:**

To test Singularity, you can pull and run a simple container like `ubuntu:latest`: `singularity pull ubuntu_latest.sif docker://ubuntu:latest` followed by `singularity exec ubuntu_latest.sif bash -c 'echo Hello from Singularity!'`. Similarly, for docker you can execute `docker run ubuntu:latest echo "Hello from Docker!"`

**Tip:** Test your setup thoroughly before starting to develop your Nextflow pipeline. This will help you identify and resolve any issues early on.

## Nextflow Basics

Before diving into genomics pipelines, let's cover the fundamental concepts and syntax of Nextflow. This section will introduce processes, channels, parameters, and basic operators, providing you with the building blocks for creating Nextflow workflows.

**Example:**

We'll create a simple "Hello World" pipeline to demonstrate the core concepts of Nextflow programming.

### Nextflow Syntax and Structure

Nextflow scripts are typically written in a file with the `.nf` extension. The script defines a workflow, which consists of processes that are connected by channels. The basic structure of a Nextflow script includes: a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env nextflow`) to specify the Nextflow interpreter, a definition of parameters, and a definition of the workflow using `process` and `workflow` blocks. Nextflow uses a declarative style, where you specify what needs to be done rather than how to do it. Comments in Nextflow scripts start with `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.

**Example:**

Here's a basic Nextflow script structure:

```nextflow
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

// Define parameters
params.input = 'data.txt'

// Define a process
process myProcess {
  input:
    file(input_file) from params.input
  output:
    stdout
  script {
    """
    cat $input_file
    """
  }
}

// Define the workflow
workflow {
  myProcess()
}
```

### Processes: Defining Tasks

A process in Nextflow is a self-contained unit of work that performs a specific task. It's defined using the `process` keyword followed by a process name and a code block. Within the process definition, you specify the inputs, outputs, and the script to be executed. The `input` section defines the data that the process needs to receive, and the `output` section defines the data that the process will produce. The `script` section contains the commands to be executed, which can be written in any scripting language (e.g., Bash, Python, R).

**Example:**

Here's an example of a process that converts a file to uppercase:

```nextflow
process toUppercase {
  input:
    file(inputFile) from inputChannel
  output:
    stdout
  script {
    """
    tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < $inputFile
    """
  }
}
```

This process takes a file as input from a channel named `inputChannel` and outputs the uppercase version of the file to standard output. Note the use of triple quotes `"""` that allow for multiline commands in the script.

### Channels: Connecting Processes

Channels in Nextflow are FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queues that connect processes, allowing data to flow between them. Channels are used to pass data from the output of one process to the input of another. You can create channels using the `Channel.from()` factory method or by defining the output of a process as a channel. Channels can carry different types of data, including files, strings, and numbers. When a process emits to a channel, the data is added to the end of the queue. When a process consumes from a channel, it receives the data from the beginning of the queue.

**Example:**

Here's an example of creating a channel from a list of files:

```nextflow
Channel.fromPath('data/*.fastq')
  .set { fastq_channel }
```

This creates a channel named `fastq_channel` that contains a list of all FASTQ files in the `data` directory. This channel can then be used as input to a process that aligns reads.  The `.set { fastq_channel }` creates a named channel to be used elsewhere in the workflow.

### Parameters: Passing Variables

Parameters in Nextflow are variables that can be used to customize the behavior of a pipeline. Parameters are defined using the `params` object and can be accessed from within processes and other parts of the script. Parameters can be set on the command line when running the pipeline using the `-param_name value` syntax. Using parameters makes your pipelines more flexible and reusable, allowing you to easily modify settings without changing the code.

**Example:**

Here's an example of defining a parameter for the reference genome:

```nextflow
params.genome = '/path/to/reference.fasta'

process align {
  input:
    file(fastq) from fastq_channel
  output:
    file('aligned.bam')
  script {
    """
    bowtie2 -x ${params.genome} -U $fastq -S aligned.sam
    """
  }
}
```

To run the pipeline with a different genome, you can use the command:

`nextflow run my_pipeline.nf -genome /path/to/another_reference.fasta`

### Basic Operators

Nextflow provides a rich set of operators that can be used to manipulate channels and data. Some commonly used operators include: `map` (applies a transformation to each item in a channel), `filter` (selects items from a channel based on a condition), `collect` (gathers all items from a channel into a list), `groupTuple` (groups items from multiple channels into tuples based on a common key), `splitFastq` (splits a FASTQ file into smaller chunks), and `join` (merges the data emitted by two channels). These operators provide powerful tools for data manipulation and processing within Nextflow pipelines.

**Example:**

Here's an example of using the `filter` operator to select only FASTQ files with a specific prefix:

```nextflow
Channel.fromPath('data/*.fastq')
  .filter { it.name.startsWith('sample_') }
  .set { filtered_fastq_channel }
```

This creates a channel named `filtered_fastq_channel` that contains only FASTQ files in the `data` directory that start with the prefix `sample_`.

### Example: Simple 'Hello World' Pipeline

Let's create a simple 'Hello World' pipeline to illustrate the basic concepts of Nextflow. This pipeline will define a process that prints the message 'Hello, World!' to the console.

**Example:**

Here's the code for the 'Hello World' pipeline:

```nextflow
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

process hello {
  output:
    stdout
  script {
    """
    echo 'Hello, World!'
    """
  }
}

workflow {
  hello()
}
```

Save this code to a file named `hello.nf` and run it using the command `nextflow run hello.nf`. You should see the message 'Hello, World!' printed to the console.

## Creating a Genomics Pipeline

This section will guide you through the process of creating a real-world genomics pipeline. We'll start by choosing a specific application (e.g., read alignment), then break down the workflow into smaller, manageable steps. We'll then write Nextflow processes for each step, connect them with channels, handle input and output files, and use software containers to ensure reproducibility.

**Example:**

We'll focus on creating a simple read alignment pipeline using Bowtie2 as an example. This pipeline will take FASTQ files as input, align them to a reference genome using Bowtie2, and output the aligned reads in BAM format.

### Choosing a Genomics Application (e.g., Read Alignment, Variant Calling)

The first step in creating a genomics pipeline is to choose a specific application. Common genomics applications include read alignment (mapping sequencing reads to a reference genome), variant calling (identifying genetic variations), genome assembly (reconstructing the genome sequence), transcript quantification (measuring gene expression levels), and metagenomic analysis (studying microbial communities). Selecting a specific application will help you define the scope and goals of your pipeline.

**Example:**

For this article, we will focus on read alignment. Read alignment is a fundamental step in many genomics analyses, as it provides the foundation for downstream analyses such as variant calling, gene expression analysis, and structural variation detection.

### Pipeline Design: Breaking Down the Workflow

Once you have chosen an application, the next step is to break down the workflow into smaller, manageable steps. Identify the individual tasks that need to be performed, the order in which they need to be executed, and the data dependencies between them. Visualizing the workflow using a diagram can be helpful. Each task will typically correspond to a Nextflow process.

**Example:**

For a read alignment pipeline, the workflow can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Input:** Receive FASTQ files containing sequencing reads.
2.  **Alignment:** Align the reads to a reference genome using Bowtie2.
3.  **Conversion:** Convert the SAM output from Bowtie2 to BAM format using Samtools.
4.  **Sorting:** Sort the BAM file by genomic coordinates using Samtools.
5.  **Output:** Output the sorted BAM file.

### Writing Nextflow Processes for Each Step

For each step in the workflow, you need to write a Nextflow process that performs the corresponding task. The process definition should include the input channels, output channels, and the script to be executed. The script should use the appropriate tools and commands to perform the task. Ensure that the process handles input and output files correctly and produces the expected results.

**Example:**

Here's the Nextflow process for aligning reads using Bowtie2:

```nextflow
process align {
  input:
    tuple val(sample_id), file(fastq)
  output:
    tuple val(sample_id), file('aligned.sam')
  container 'quay.io/biocontainers/bowtie2:2.4.5--py39he621ea3_0'
  script {
    """
    bowtie2 -x ref/genome -U $fastq -S aligned.sam
    """
  }
}
```

This process takes a FASTQ file as input and aligns it to a reference genome using Bowtie2, producing a SAM file as output. The `container` directive specifies the Docker image to use for running Bowtie2. Note, the ref/genome needs to exist within the container. This is usually done by building the container image with the reference genome data included. The triple quotes allow for multiline shell commands. The `tuple val(sample_id), file(fastq)` input means that the process expects a tuple of two elements, the first one is a sample ID and the second one is the fastq file to process.

### Connecting Processes with Channels

Channels are used to connect the processes in your pipeline, allowing data to flow from one process to the next. The output of one process becomes the input of another process. Use the `->` operator to send the output of a process to a channel. Ensure that the data types and formats are compatible between the input and output channels.

**Example:**

To connect the `align` process to a process that converts the SAM file to BAM format, you can use the following code:

```nextflow
align(fastq_channel) -> sam_channel
```

This sends the output of the `align` process to a channel named `sam_channel`, which can then be used as input to the next process.

### Handling Input and Output Files

Properly handling input and output files is crucial for a successful pipeline. Nextflow provides several ways to specify input files, including using `Channel.fromPath()` to create channels from file paths and using parameters to specify input file names. When defining processes, use the `file()` keyword to indicate that an input or output is a file. Use absolute paths or relative paths within the working directory of the process. Be mindful of file permissions and storage locations on the HPC cluster.

**Example:**

Here's an example of creating a channel from a list of FASTQ files using `Channel.fromPath()`:

```nextflow
Channel.fromPath('data/*.fastq')
  .map { file -> tuple(file.name.replace('.fastq', ''), file) }
  .set { fastq_channel }
```

This creates a channel named `fastq_channel` that contains a list of all FASTQ files in the `data` directory. The `map` operator creates a tuple of sample ID and file.  The `{ file -> tuple(file.name.replace('.fastq', ''), file) }` is a closure that takes the `file` object and creates a tuple.

### Using Software Containers (Docker/Singularity) for Reproducibility

Software containers (like Docker and Singularity) are essential for ensuring reproducibility in genomics pipelines. Containers package software and its dependencies into a self-contained unit, ensuring that the pipeline will run consistently across different environments. Nextflow seamlessly integrates with Docker and Singularity, allowing you to specify the container to use for each process. Using containers eliminates dependency conflicts and ensures that your pipeline will produce the same results regardless of the underlying system configuration.

**Example:**

To use a Docker container for the `align` process, you can add the `container` directive to the process definition:

```nextflow
process align {
  input:
    tuple val(sample_id), file(fastq)
  output:
    tuple val(sample_id), file('aligned.sam')
  container 'quay.io/biocontainers/bowtie2:2.4.5--py39he621ea3_0'
  script {
    """
    bowtie2 -x ref/genome -U $fastq -S aligned.sam
    """
  }
}
```

This tells Nextflow to run the `align` process inside the `quay.io/biocontainers/bowtie2:2.4.5--py39he621ea3_0` Docker container. For Singularity, the syntax is similar: `container 'docker://quay.io/biocontainers/bowtie2:2.4.5--py39he621ea3_0'` if using automatic conversion or the path to the `.sif` image.

**Tip:** Using biocontainers from [Quay.io](https://quay.io/) can save time and effort, as they provide pre-built containers for many common bioinformatics tools.

### Example: Simple Read Alignment Pipeline (e.g., using Bowtie2)

Let's put everything together and create a complete read alignment pipeline using Bowtie2. This pipeline will take FASTQ files as input, align them to a reference genome using Bowtie2, convert the SAM output to BAM format, sort the BAM file, and output the sorted BAM file.

**Example:**

Here's the code for the complete read alignment pipeline:

```nextflow
#!/usr/bin/env nextflow

params.genome = 'ref/genome'

Channel.fromPath('data/*.fastq')
  .map { file -> tuple(file.name.replace('.fastq', ''), file) }
  .set { fastq_channel }

process align {
  input:
    tuple val(sample_id), file(fastq)
  output:
    tuple val(sample_id), file('aligned.sam')
  container 'quay.io/biocontainers/bowtie2:2.4.5--py39he621ea3_0'
  script {
    """
    bowtie2 -x ${params.genome} -U $fastq -S aligned.sam
    """
  }
}

process samtools_view {
  input:
    tuple val(sample_id), file(sam)
  output:
    tuple val(sample_id), file('aligned.bam')
  container 'quay.io/biocontainers/samtools:1.16.1--htslib1.16_hd030954_0'
  script {
    """
    samtools view -bS $sam > aligned.bam
    """
  }
}

process samtools_sort {
  input:
    tuple val(sample_id), file(bam)
  output:
    tuple val(sample_id), file('aligned.sorted.bam')
  container 'quay.io/biocontainers/samtools:1.16.1--htslib1.16_hd030954_0'
  script {
    """
    samtools sort $bam -o aligned.sorted.bam
    """
  }
}

workflow {
  align(fastq_channel) -> sam_channel
  samtools_view(sam_channel) -> bam_channel
  samtools_sort(bam_channel)
}
```

Save this code to a file named `alignment.nf` and run it using the command `nextflow run alignment.nf` after placing some `.fastq` files in a directory named `data` and creating a reference index. The pipeline will align the reads, convert the SAM file to BAM format, sort the BAM file, and output the sorted BAM file. Note that the reference `ref/genome` and the index it represents, must be available within the container. This simple example lacks error handling and could be improved with logging and input validation for production use.

**Alert:** Remember to create the `data` directory and place your `.fastq` files inside it before running the pipeline. Also ensure that the reference genome index is available within the container, and the path to it is correctly specified in the `params.genome` parameter.

**Tip:**  For real-world use cases, consider adding error handling, logging, and input validation to your pipelines to make them more robust and easier to debug.
