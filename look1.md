**Title:** Creating a Genomics Nextflow Pipeline on a University HPC Cluster

**Introduction:**

Genomics research often involves processing large datasets with complex workflows. Nextflow is a powerful workflow management system that simplifies the creation and execution of data-intensive pipelines. High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters provide the necessary computational resources for such tasks. This article guides you through the process of creating and running a genomics Nextflow pipeline on a university HPC cluster. It's designed for researchers with a basic understanding of genomics, command-line interfaces, and HPC concepts, but no prior Nextflow experience is required. This article aims to provide a step-by-step guide with practical examples and considerations specific to a university HPC environment.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Nextflow:** A workflow management system that enables scalable and reproducible computational pipelines using the Dataflow programming model. It simplifies the orchestration of complex tasks and manages dependencies automatically.
*   **Pipeline:** A series of connected processing steps applied to data to achieve a specific analytical goal. In genomics, this might include steps like read alignment, variant calling, and annotation.
*   **HPC Cluster:** A collection of interconnected computers (nodes) that work together as a single system to perform high-performance computing tasks. HPC clusters offer significant computational power and storage capacity.
*   **Scheduler (e.g., Slurm, PBS/Torque):** A software system that manages and allocates resources (CPU cores, memory, GPU) on an HPC cluster to different jobs. Nextflow integrates with schedulers to distribute tasks efficiently.
*   **Modules:** Software packages pre-installed on the HPC cluster, accessible by loading them into your environment. Modules manage dependencies and avoid conflicts between different software versions.
*   **Containers (e.g., Docker, Singularity):** Portable, self-contained environments that package software and their dependencies. Containers ensure reproducibility by isolating the pipeline from the underlying system.
*   **nf-core:** A community effort to develop curated, standardized, and peer-reviewed Nextflow pipelines for common genomics workflows.

**Structure and Sections:**

**1. Background: Why Nextflow on an HPC Cluster?**

*   **Genomics Data Processing Challenges:** Discuss the challenges of managing complex genomics workflows, large datasets, and software dependencies.
*   **Benefits of Nextflow:** Explain how Nextflow addresses these challenges by providing a declarative programming model, automatic dependency management, and portability.
*   **HPC Cluster Advantages:** Highlight the advantages of using an HPC cluster for genomics analysis, including scalability, access to specialized hardware (GPUs), and managed environment.

**2. Setting Up Your Environment on the HPC Cluster**

*   **2.1 Accessing the HPC Cluster:**
    *   Explain how to connect to the HPC cluster using SSH (Secure Shell).
    *   Provide an example SSH command: `ssh username@cluster.university.edu`
    *   Mention the need for VPN if accessing from off-campus.
*   **2.2 Allocating Resources:**
    *   Describe the process of submitting jobs to the scheduler (e.g., Slurm).
    *   Illustrate with an example Slurm script (`submit.sh`):

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --job-name=nextflow_pipeline
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4
    #SBATCH --mem=16G
    #SBATCH --time=00:30:00
    #SBATCH --output=nextflow.out
    #SBATCH --error=nextflow.err

    module load nextflow
    nextflow run your_pipeline.nf -profile hpc
    ```

    *   Explain the meaning of each `#SBATCH` option (job name, number of tasks, CPUs per task, memory, time limit, output/error files).
    *   Explain how to submit the script using `sbatch submit.sh`.
*   **2.3 Installing Nextflow (if necessary):**
    *   Check if Nextflow is already available as a module using `module avail nextflow`.
    *   If not, explain how to download and install Nextflow locally:

    ```bash
    curl -s get.nextflow.io | bash
    mv nextflow ~/bin/
    export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/
    ```

    *   Alternatively, use `conda`:

    ```bash
    conda create -n nextflow -c bioconda nextflow
    conda activate nextflow
    ```

*   **2.4 Installing Containers (Docker/Singularity):**
    *   Many HPCs prefer singularity due to security constraints.  Check with your HPC administrators.
    *   Explain the basics of how Docker and Singularity work.
    *   If Docker is available (less common on HPC):
        *   `docker pull hello-world` to test your Docker installation.
    *   If Singularity is available:
        *   Check if Singularity is available as a module: `module avail singularity`.
        *   `singularity pull docker://hello-world` to test.

**3. Writing a Simple Nextflow Pipeline**

*   **3.1 Creating the `nextflow.config` file:**
    *   Explain the purpose of the `nextflow.config` file (configuration settings).
    *   Create a basic configuration file:

    ```nextflow
    process {
      executor = 'slurm'
      queue = 'your_queue' // e.g., 'standard' or 'long'

      withName: process_name {  //Optional - configure a specific process
            cpus = 8
            memory = '32.GB'
      }

    }

    executor {
        slurm {
            queue = 'your_queue'
        }
    }

    profiles {
      hpc {
        process.executor = 'slurm'
        process.queue = 'your_queue'
      }
    }

    docker.enabled = true // or false if using singularity
    docker.runOptions = '-u $(id -u):$(id -g)'  //Fix permissions inside container (if using docker).

    singularity.enabled = true  //If using singularity
    ```

    *   Explain the meaning of `executor`, `queue`, `cpus`, and `memory`.  Emphasize that 'your_queue' will vary based on the HPC. Contact the cluster administrators for the appropriate queue names.
    *   Explain the profiles block for activating cluster settings.
    *   Explain the settings for docker or singularity usage.
*   **3.2 Creating the `main.nf` file:**
    *   Introduce the basic structure of a Nextflow script (processes, channels, workflows).
    *   Create a simple pipeline to read a text file and print its contents:

    ```nextflow
    #!/usr/bin/env nextflow

    params.input_file = 'input.txt'

    process read_file {
      output:
      file('output.txt') into file_contents

      script:
      """
      cat ${params.input_file} > output.txt
      """
    }

    workflow {
      read_file()
      file_contents.view()
    }
    ```

    *   Explain the `process`, `input`, `output`, and `script` sections.
    *   Explain the concept of channels for data flow.
    *   Explain the `workflow` section for defining the execution order.
*   **3.3 Creating the `input.txt` file:**
    *   Create a simple input file:

    ```text
    Hello, Nextflow on HPC!
    ```

**4. Running the Pipeline on the HPC Cluster**

*   **4.1 Submitting the Job:**
    *   Submit the job using the Slurm script (e.g., `sbatch submit.sh`).
*   **4.2 Monitoring the Job:**
    *   Check the job status using `squeue -u your_username`.
    *   View the output and error logs (e.g., `tail -f nextflow.out`, `tail -f nextflow.err`).
*   **4.3 Examining the Results:**
    *   Check the `work` directory for intermediate files and results.
    *   Verify that the `output.txt` file contains the contents of `input.txt`.

**5. Troubleshooting and Common Issues**

*   **5.1 Permission Errors:**
    *   Explain how to fix permission errors by setting appropriate file permissions.
    *   Consider setting `docker.runOptions = '-u $(id -u):$(id -g)'` in the nextflow.config file when using Docker.
*   **5.2 Resource Limits:**
    *   Explain how to adjust resource limits (CPU, memory, time) in the Slurm script or `nextflow.config` file.
    *   Highlight the importance of estimating resource requirements accurately.
*   **5.3 Module Conflicts:**
    *   Explain how to resolve module conflicts by loading the correct module versions.
    *   Use `module list` to see what modules are loaded.
*   **5.4 Container Issues:**
    *   Troubleshoot container-related issues, such as image not found or container runtime errors.
    *   Ensure the image is available (docker pull) or converted (singularity pull).
*   **5.5 Nextflow Errors:**
    *   Examine Nextflow error messages for clues about the cause of the problem.
    *   Use the `-resume` option to restart the pipeline from the point of failure.

**6. Best Practices for HPC Pipelines**

*   **6.1 Use Containers for Reproducibility:**
    *   Emphasize the importance of using containers to ensure that the pipeline runs consistently across different environments.
*   **6.2 Optimize Resource Allocation:**
    *   Allocate resources efficiently to minimize job queue time and maximize throughput.
    *   Use the `withName` directive to tailor resource allocation for specific processes.
*   **6.3 Implement Error Handling:**
    *   Add error handling mechanisms to your pipeline to gracefully handle unexpected errors.
    *   Use the `errorStrategy` directive to control how Nextflow handles errors.
*   **6.4 Version Control Your Pipeline:**
    *   Use Git to track changes to your pipeline code and ensure reproducibility.
*   **6.5 Use nf-core pipelines where appropriate:**
       *  Many common pipelines have been created and tested by the community.  Consider using these as a starting point.
