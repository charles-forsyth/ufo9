    "title": "Creating a Genomics Nextflow Pipeline on a University HPC Cluster",
    "introduction": "This guide will walk you through creating and running genomics Nextflow pipelines on your university's HPC cluster. Nextflow is a powerful workflow engine that simplifies the development and execution of complex bioinformatic analyses. Using the HPC cluster allows you to leverage its computational resources for large-scale genomic datasets. This tutorial covers setting up your environment, creating a basic pipeline, using pre-built `nf-core` pipelines, utilizing containerization for reproducibility, and best practices for HPC pipeline development. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped to design, execute, and manage your own genomics pipelines on the HPC cluster.\n\n**Example:** Imagine you need to analyze a large RNA-seq dataset to identify differentially expressed genes. Instead of manually running each tool (e.g., alignment, quantification, differential expression), you can create a Nextflow pipeline to automate the entire process on the HPC cluster, drastically reducing the time and effort required.",

This involves creating a `nextflow.config` file in your pipeline directory or in your home directory. This file tells Nextflow how to submit jobs to the cluster and how to manage resources. Specifically, you'll need to define a 'executor' that specifies the SLURM scheduler. You also need to configure the HPC's file system correctly to provide temporary storage for the jobs running in the cluster.\n\nCreate a `nextflow.config` file with the following content (adjust the queue name and other parameters based on your cluster's configuration):\n\n```groovy\nprocess {\n    executor = 'slurm'\n    queue = 'your_queue_name' // Replace with your cluster's queue name\n}\n\nexecutor {\n    slurm {\n        queue = 'your_queue_name'\n        submitDir = '.nextflow/slurmdir'  //Crucial: Ensure this directory exists and you have write access\n    }\n}\n\ntracing {\n    enabled = true\n}\n\nparams.outdir = './results'\n```\n\n*   **`process.executor = 'slurm'`**: Specifies that processes should be executed using the SLURM scheduler.\n*   **`process.queue = 'your_queue_name'`**: Sets the default queue for all processes.

Contact your HPC administrators to find the proper queue name for your research.\n*   **`executor.slurm.queue = 'your_queue_name'`**: Defines the queue specifically for the SLURM executor.\n*   **`executor.slurm.submitDir = '.nextflow/slurmdir'`**: Sets the directory where SLURM job submission scripts are stored. Crucially, ensure this directory exists and that you have write permissions to it using `mkdir -p .nextflow/slurmdir`.\n*   **`tracing.enabled = true`**: Enables tracing to monitor the execution of your pipeline.\n*   **`params.outdir = './results'`**: Defines the default output directory for results."
